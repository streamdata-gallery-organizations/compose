description: Build Your Best with MongoDB and Elasticsearch. Compose is a fully-managed
  platform used by developers to deploy, host and scale databases. Compose deployments
  scale seamlessly as your data grows. Spend more time on your data model, less time
  capacity planning. This is how everyone should run databases. Backups, replication,
  complete monitoring. Three essentials of a production database deployment. Spend
  your time building apps, let us worry about production operations.
